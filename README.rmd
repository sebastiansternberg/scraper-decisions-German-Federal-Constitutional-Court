This Github contains the code necessary to scrape informatin from all Chamber (Kammer) decisions of the German Constituztional Court from the website.


ToDo:

- Run scraper again with the trim s stuff. 
- Check the names then and replace the ones which are missing. 
- for this use the names of all the individual judges and see whether they appear or not. 
- use check N richter again to verify the new changes.
